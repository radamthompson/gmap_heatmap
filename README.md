# gmap_heatmap

Created scripts to generate a heatmap of run data, using Fitbit '.tcx' files and the google maps API.

You will need your own Google Maps API token, which I did following these [instructions](https://parthsamin.medium.com/heatmap-with-python-and-googlemaps-tutorial-b3d623b77c95).

You will also need to download the '.tcx' files from your Fitbit [account](https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1133.htm) and place them into the <code>/run_logs/</code> folder.
